### 4.2.1 Robot Control

(1) Tap the corresponding icon <img src="../_static/media/chapter_4/section_2/image2.png" style="width:70px" /> on the main screen to enter the **"AiNova Control"** interface.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_4/section_2/image3.png"   />

(2) Function descriptions for each icon are listed below:

|                           **Icon**                           |                         **Function**                         |
| :----------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
| <img src="../_static/media/chapter_4/section_2/image4.png" /> |      Control AiNova to move forward, backward, or turn.      |
| <img src="../_static/media/chapter_4/section_2/image5.png" /> | When enabled, AiNova can be moved using the phone's gravity sensing. |
| <img src="../_static/media/chapter_4/section_2/image6.png" /> | When enabled, AiNova will perform obstacle avoidance using the ultrasonic sensor. |
| <img src="../_static/media/chapter_4/section_2/image7.png" /> | Displays the distance between the ultrasonic sensor and the object in front of it. Only works when obstacle avoidance is enabled. |
| <img src="../_static/media/chapter_4/section_2/image8.png" /> | Used to adjust the threshold for obstacle avoidance. Only works when obstacle avoidance is enabled. |
| <img src="../_static/media/chapter_4/section_2/image9.png" /> |               Turns the RGB lights on or off.                |
| <img src="../_static/media/chapter_4/section_2/image10.png" /> |   Use the slider to change the RGB light color on AiNova.    |
| <img src="../_static/media/chapter_4/section_2/image11.png" /> | Tap to connect/disconnect the Bluetooth device. Once connected, it also displays the battery level. |

### 4.2.2 Line tracking

(1) Tap the corresponding icon <img  src="../_static/media/chapter_4/section_2/image12.png" style="width:70px" /> on the main screen to enter the **"Line tracking"** interface.

:::{Note}

The robot may deviate when moving in a straight line. This is due to mechanical bias and is a normal phenomenon. You can reduce the deviation by adjusting the differential speed between the left and right motors. See the document in the same directory: Solution to Not Move Straight

:::

(2) Place the AiNova robot on the line-following map and tap the icon <img src="../_static/media/chapter_4/section_2/image13.png" style="width:70px" /> on the screen to start the function.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_4/section_2/image14.png" />

If the result is unsatisfactory, refer to "[**Debugging and Instructional Guidance**]()" for "[**Line-Following Sensor Sensitivity Adjustment**]()."

### 4.2.3 Draw to Follow

(1) Tap the corresponding icon <img src="../_static/media/chapter_4/section_2/image15.png" style="width:70px" /> on the main screen to enter the "**Draw to Follow**" interface.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_4/section_2/image16.png" />

(2) Select a shape you want the robot to follow, for example, Triangle. As shown in the image below. Then tap the icon <img src="../_static/media/chapter_4/section_2/image17.png" style="width:70px" /> to run the program.

## 4.3 Solution to Not Move Straight

### 4.3.1 Reason 

The motor itself has deviations. Though two motors are set to the same speed in the program, their actual speeds may deffer due to the slight deviations caused by internal gear reduction ration. If the left wheel is faster than the right wheel, the robot will veer to the the right. Conversely, if the left wheel is slower than the right wheel, the robot will veer to the left.

### 4.3.2 Solution

Try to adjust the wheels to have an equal spacing during assembly. When writing the control program, set different speeds for the two wheels to compensate for the inherent errors of the deceleration motor by utilizing the speed difference. The specific method is as follow: when the robot veers to one side, slowly increase the speed of the motor on that side without changing the speed of the other motor until the robot can move in a straight line.
